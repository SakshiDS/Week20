Week 20 - Natural Language Processing

#### frequency.py
frequency.py python file can be used to count the frequency of all words and punctuation in a text file that we use as input, ordered by frequency.
Here I show an example where I pass the cats_txt.txt file to frequency.py.
To do this I run the below command on CLI under the folder where I have created the .py file:
>>cat ../cats_txt.txt|./frequency.py

Below is the screenshot of the output:

####This is highly useful tool for NLP as it provides an understanding of the text. For NLP we need to first understand the general idea behind a text. To see the most frequent words gives us an idea about what is the intent of the text and we can build a model accoridng to that.
